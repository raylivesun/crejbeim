// 5.  **Explain the Physical Role and Interpretation of `cosh`:** This is the crucial part. 
//     Connect the math to the physics.
//     *   **General Solution Structure:** The general solution for voltage `V(x)` or current 
//     `I(x)` is of the form `A*cosh(αx) + B*sinh(αx)`. The constants A and B are determined by 
//     boundary conditions (e.g., voltage/current at x=0 and x=L).
//     *   **Dominance in Voltage Expressions:** Explain that `cosh` often appears 
//     prominently in the expression for *voltage* `V(x)`.
//     *   **Symmetry and Boundary Conditions:**
//         *   Since `cosh(0) = 1`, it naturally represents the scaling of the input 
//     condition. If `V(0) = V₀` is applied at the start (`x=0`), the `cosh(αx)` term often 
//     carries this initial value.
//         *   Consider a common scenario: Voltage `V₀` applied at `x=0`, end at `x=L` open-circuited (`I(L) = 0`). The voltage solution often looks like:
//             `V(x) = V₀ * [cosh(α(L-x)) / cosh(αL)]`
//         *   **Interpretation of this example:**
//             *   The `cosh(α(L-x))` term: At the *end* of the line (`x=L`), the argument is 0, 
//     so `cosh(0)=1`. The voltage isn't necessarily `V₀` there due to the denominator, but the 
//    term itself reaches its minimum (1). As you move *away* from the end (decreasing `x`, increasing 
//    `L-x`), `cosh` grows. This reflects how the voltage along the line increases as you get 
//    closer to the driving source (`x=0`), accounting for the voltage drop across the resistance 
//    *and* the effect of leakage.
//             *   The `cosh(αL)` in the denominator normalizes the expression, ensuring `V(0) = V₀`. 
//     The value `cosh(αL)` reflects the overall "difficulty" or attenuation/change across the total 
//     length `L` due to both resistance and leakage.
//     *   **Relationship to Average/Standing Wave:** Connect `cosh(y) = (e^y + e^-y)/2` to the 
//     idea of an average between forward (`e^y`) and backward (`e^-y`) propagating or decaying exponential components. 
//     This helps visualize it as representing the magnitude or "level" of the voltage along the line.
//     *   **Contrast with `sinh`:** Briefly mention that `sinh` (related to differences, gradients, 
//     `sinh(0)=0`) is often more directly associated with the *current* needed to supply the leakage 
//     or handle specific boundary conditions like shorts or open ends away from the input.
