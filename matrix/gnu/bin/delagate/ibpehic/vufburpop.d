// Okay, let's focus on **`cosh` (Hyperbolic Cosine)** within the context 
// of analyzing a current path with distributed resistance and leakage 
// through passivation.

// **Mathematical Definition:**

// First, the definition:
// `cosh(x) = (e^x + e^-x) / 2`

// Key properties relevant here:
// *   It's an even function: `cosh(-x) = cosh(x)`
// *   `cosh(0) = 1`
// *   Its derivative is `sinh(x)`
// *   For real `x`, `cosh(x)` is always greater than or equal to 1.
// *   It behaves like `1 + x²/2` for small `x` and grows exponentially 
// like `e^|x| / 2` for large `x`.

// equations:
// *   `d²V/dx² = r * g * V`
// *   `d²I/dx² = r * g * I`

// Defining the characteristic parameter `α = sqrt(r * g)`, these become:
// *   `d²V/dx² = α² * V`
// *   `d²I/dx² = α² * I`
