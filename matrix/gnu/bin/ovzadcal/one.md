Okay, "one".

Could you please clarify what you mean by "one" in this context? It could refer to several things:

1.  **One specific example?** Are you asking for one concrete example of a current path where `cosh` and `sinh` are used due to passivation leakage?
2.  **Focus on one aspect?** Do you want me to elaborate on just *one* specific point from the previous explanations (e.g., just the leakage, just the `cosh` function)?
3.  **The number 1?** Are you asking about the value of `cosh(1)` or `sinh(1)` (though this seems less likely given the context)?
4.  **Something else?**

Please provide a little more detail so I can give you the information you're looking for!
