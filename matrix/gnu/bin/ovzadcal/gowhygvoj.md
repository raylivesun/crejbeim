Okay, let's break down the introduction of `cosh` (hyperbolic cosine) and `sinh` (hyperbolic sine) in the context of analyzing a current path related to passivation.

**Context:**

Passivation layers in semiconductor devices or on metal surfaces are designed to protect the underlying material and often act as insulators. However, they are not perfect. There can be:

1.  **Leakage Current:** Current flowing *through* the passivation layer (e.g., to the substrate or another layer).
2.  **Current in Associated Conductors:** Current flowing *along* a conductive path (like a metal interconnect or a polysilicon line) that is *covered* by passivation or is part of the passivated structure itself.

The `cosh` and `sinh` functions typically appear when analyzing situation #2, specifically when the conductive path has **distributed resistance** along its length and **distributed leakage conductance** *through* the passivation (or an associated dielectric layer) to a reference plane (like the substrate).

**Introduction:**

When analyzing the flow of electrical current along a specific path associated with a passivation layer – such as a long, thin conductor (like an interconnect or resistor) sitting on an insulating substrate and covered by passivation – we often need a more sophisticated model than simple Ohm's Law. This is especially true if the path itself has significant resistance along its length, and if there's some current leakage *through* the passivation layer (or the underlying dielectric) to the substrate or another conductive layer beneath it.

This scenario can be modeled as a **distributed network**, essentially an infinite series of tiny resistors (representing the resistance of the path segments) and tiny conductors (representing the leakage through the passivation/dielectric per unit length). Analyzing the voltage and current distribution along such a path leads to a **second-order linear differential equation**.

The **hyperbolic functions, `cosh(x)` and `sinh(x)`, arise naturally as the solutions** to these types of differential equations. They describe how voltage and current vary along the length of the conductive path, taking into account both the resistive voltage drop along the path and the current lost due to leakage through the passivation/dielectric.

*   **`cosh(αL)` terms** (where α relates to the resistance and conductance per unit length, and L is position or total length) often appear in expressions for voltage distribution, particularly relating to the voltage at points along the line relative to the input voltage.
*   **`sinh(αL)` terms** often appear in expressions for current distribution, relating to how the current flowing *along* the path diminishes due to leakage.

In essence, `cosh` and `sinh` provide a concise mathematical way to describe the exponential-like decay and interaction of voltage and current waves travelling along a resistive path with distributed leakage – a common scenario when analyzing the detailed electrical behaviour of structures involving passivation layers in integrated circuits, MEMS, or other microelectronic devices. They help engineers predict voltage drops, current losses, and signal integrity along these critical paths.
