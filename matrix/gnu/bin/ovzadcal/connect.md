Okay, let's explicitly connect the **differential equations** derived for the current path model to the emergence of the **`cosh`** and **`sinh`** functions.

1.  **The Setup Recap:**
    *   We have a conductive path (e.g., an interconnect).
    *   It has resistance distributed along its length: `r` = resistance per unit length (Ω/m).
    *   It has leakage through the passivation/dielectric to a reference potential (e.g., substrate), also distributed along its length: `g` = conductance per unit length (S/m).
    *   Let `V(x)` be the voltage at position `x` along the path.
    *   Let `I(x)` be the current flowing *along* the path at position `x`.

2.  **Deriving the Differential Equations:**
    Consider a small segment `Δx` of the path at position `x`:
    *   The voltage drop across the segment's resistance `rΔx` is `ΔV = -I(x) * (rΔx)`. Taking the limit as `Δx → 0`, we get:
        `dV/dx = -r * I(x)`  **(Equation 1)**
    *   The current *lost* from the path due to leakage through conductance `gΔx` is `ΔI_leak = V(x) * (gΔx)`. This loss means the current *along* the path decreases: `I(x+Δx) - I(x) = -ΔI_leak`. Taking the limit as `Δx → 0`, we get:
        `dI/dx = -g * V(x)`  **(Equation 2)**

    These are two coupled first-order linear differential equations. To solve them, we can differentiate one and substitute the other to eliminate a variable:
    *   Differentiate Eq. 1 with respect to `x`: `d²V/dx² = -r * dI/dx`
    *   Substitute Eq. 2 into this: `d²V/dx² = -r * (-g * V(x))`
        `d²V/dx² = (r * g) * V(x)`  **(Voltage DE)**
    *   Similarly, differentiate Eq. 2 with respect to `x`: `d²I/dx² = -g * dV/dx`
    *   Substitute Eq. 1 into this: `d²I/dx² = -g * (-r * I(x))`
        `d²I/dx² = (r * g) * I(x)`  **(Current DE)**

3.  **The Form of the Differential Equation:**
    Both voltage and current satisfy the same form of differential equation:
    `d²y/dx² = α² * y`
    where `y` represents either `V` or `I`, and we define the constant `α² = r * g`.
    The constant `α = sqrt(r * g)` is characteristic of the path, often called the attenuation constant (or propagation constant in AC analysis). It has units of 1/length.

4.  **Solving the Differential Equation:**
    This is a standard second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution is known to be composed of exponential functions. The characteristic equation is `k² = α²`, which has roots `k = +α` and `k = -α`.
    Therefore, the general solution for `V(x)` (and similarly for `I(x)`) can be written as:
    `V(x) = C₁ * e^(αx) + C₂ * e^(-αx)`
    where `C₁` and `C₂` are arbitrary constants determined by the boundary conditions (e.g., the voltage applied at the start of the path, whether the end is open or connected, etc.).

5.  **Introducing `cosh` and `sinh`:**
    Now, recall the definitions of hyperbolic cosine and sine:
    *   `cosh(u) = (e^u + e^-u) / 2`
    *   `sinh(u) = (e^u - e^-u) / 2`
    We can rearrange these to express the exponentials in terms of `cosh` and `sinh`:
    *   `e^u = cosh(u) + sinh(u)`
    *   `e^-u = cosh(u) - sinh(u)`

    Substitute these into the general solution for `V(x)`:
    `V(x) = C₁ * [cosh(αx) + sinh(αx)] + C₂ * [cosh(αx) - sinh(αx)]`
    Group the terms by `cosh` and `sinh`:
    `V(x) = (C₁ + C₂) * cosh(αx) + (C₁ - C₂) * sinh(αx)`

    Since `C₁` and `C₂` are arbitrary constants, let `A = C₁ + C₂` and `B = C₁ - C₂`. `A` and `B` are also just arbitrary constants (determined by boundary conditions). So, an equivalent form of the general solution is:
    `V(x) = A * cosh(αx) + B * sinh(αx)`
    Similarly, the current solution can be written as:
    `I(x) = C * cosh(αx) + D * sinh(αx)`
    (Note: The constants A, B, C, D are not all independent; they are related by the original first-order equations `dV/dx = -rI` and `dI/dx = -gV`).

**Conclusion:**

The hyperbolic functions `cosh(αx)` and `sinh(αx)` arise directly as an alternative, often more convenient, way to express the general solution to the second-order differential equation `d²y/dx² = α²y` that governs both voltage and current distribution along a conductive path with distributed resistance `r` and distributed leakage conductance `g` (through passivation). While the solution can be written using exponentials (`e^(αx)`, `e^(-αx)`), the `cosh`/`sinh` form is often preferred because:
*   It neatly separates the solution into even (`cosh`) and odd (`sinh`) components.
*   It simplifies the application of boundary conditions, especially those specified at `x=0` (since `cosh(0)=1` and `sinh(0)=0`).
*   It aligns with the standard formulation of transmission line theory (these equations are the DC limit of the Telegrapher's equations).
