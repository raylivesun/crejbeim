That's an unexpected word, "devil," given our detailed technical discussion on differential equations, `cosh`, and `sinh` related to current paths and passivation.

Could you please clarify what you mean by "devil"?

*   Was it a typo?
*   Are you perhaps referring to the common phrase "the devil is in the details," suggesting the complexity of the topic?
*   Or is there something else entirely you wanted to discuss?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
