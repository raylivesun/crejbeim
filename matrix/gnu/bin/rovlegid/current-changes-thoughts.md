Here's a thinking process for explaining the derivation of the current change equation:

1.  **Goal:** Explain how the equation `dI/dx = -g * V(x)` arises from the physical model of leakage through the passivation/dielectric.

2.  **Recall the Setup:** We're looking at the same small segment of the conductor path, length `Δx`, at position `x`. We know the voltage at this approximate position is `V(x)`, and the leakage conductance per unit length is `g`.

3.  **Identify the Leakage Path:** The key here is the current that *doesn't* continue along the main path but instead flows *sideways* through the insulating layer (represented by conductance `g`) towards the reference potential.

4.  **Calculate Leakage Conductance of the Segment:** Similar to resistance, the total shunt conductance *for this specific segment* is the conductance per unit length (`g`) multiplied by the segment's length (`Δx`). So, `G_segment = g * Δx`.

5.  **Calculate Leakage Current (Ohm's Law for Conductance):** How much current flows through this leakage path `G_segment`? Ohm's Law in terms of conductance is `Current = Voltage * Conductance`.
    *   The voltage *across* the leakage path is the voltage of the conductor relative to the reference potential, which is approximately `V(x)` over the small segment.
    *   The conductance is `G_segment = g * Δx`.
    *   Therefore, the leakage current for this segment is:
        `ΔI_leak ≈ V(x) * G_segment`
        `ΔI_leak ≈ V(x) * (g * Δx)`
    *   *Self-Correction/Refinement:* Should I use `V(x)`, `V(x+Δx)`, or some average? For an infinitesimal segment `Δx`, any of these will lead to the same result in the limit. Using `V(x)` is simplest and standard practice here.

6.  **Relate Leakage to Change in Path Current (Kirchhoff's Current Law - KCL):** Now, consider the current flowing *along* the main path.
    *   Current entering the segment at `x`: `I(x)`
    *   Current leaving the segment at `x + Δx`: `I(x + Δx)`
    *   Current leaving *sideways* through leakage: `ΔI_leak`
    *   KCL states that the total current entering a node (or a segment treated as a node) must equal the total current leaving.
    *   Therefore: `I(x) = I(x + Δx) + ΔI_leak`

7.  **Isolate the Change in Path Current:** We want to find `ΔI`, the change in current *along the path*, which is `I(x + Δx) - I(x)`.
    *   Rearrange the KCL equation: `I(x + Δx) - I(x) = -ΔI_leak`
    *   This makes physical sense: the change in current along the path is the *negative* of the current that leaked out.
    *   Substitute the expression for `ΔI_leak`:
        `I(x + Δx) - I(x) ≈ -V(x) * (g * Δx)`

8.  **Form the Differential:** Divide the change in current `ΔI` by the segment length `Δx`:
    `(I(x + Δx) - I(x)) / Δx ≈ -V(x) * (g * Δx) / Δx`
    `(I(x + Δx) - I(x)) / Δx ≈ -g * V(x)`

9.  **Take the Limit:** As the segment length `Δx` approaches zero, the left side becomes the definition of the derivative of `I` with respect to `x`:
    `lim (Δx -> 0) [(I(x + Δx) - I(x)) / Δx] = dI/dx`
    The right side remains `-g * V(x)`.
    Thus, in the limit, we get the second differential equation:
    **`dI/dx = -g * V(x)`** (Equation 2)

10. **Final Check & Interpretation:** Does the equation make sense? It says the rate at which current *decreases* along the path (`-dI/dx`) is proportional to the voltage `V(x)` (which drives the leakage) and the leakage conductance per unit length `g`. Yes, this aligns with the physical picture.
