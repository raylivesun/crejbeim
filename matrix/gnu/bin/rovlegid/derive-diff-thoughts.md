The user wants to see the derivation of the differential equations governing voltage `V(x)` and current `I(x)` for the distributed `r-g` model. I need to focus on a small segment `Δx` and apply fundamental circuit laws (Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Current Law).

1.  **Define variables for the segment:**
    *   Voltage at the start of the segment (position `x`): `V(x)`
    *   Voltage at the end of the segment (position `x + Δx`): `V(x + Δx)`
    *   Current entering the segment (position `x`): `I(x)`
    *   Current leaving the segment (position `x + Δx`): `I(x + Δx)`

2.  **Analyze the voltage drop across the series resistance:**
    *   The resistance of the segment is `r * Δx`.
    *   The voltage drop across this resistance is `ΔV = V(x + Δx) - V(x)`.
    *   According to Ohm's Law, this voltage drop is caused by the current `I(x)` flowing through the resistance `r * Δx`. (We can approximate the current through the segment as `I(x)` for small `Δx`, or `I(x + Δx/2)` for better accuracy, but it leads to the same result in the limit).
    *   So, `V(x + Δx) - V(x) = -I(x) * (r * Δx)`. The minus sign is crucial because voltage drops in the direction of positive current flow.
    *   Divide by `Δx`: `[V(x + Δx) - V(x)] / Δx = -r * I(x)`.
    *   Take the limit as `Δx → 0`: The left side becomes the definition of the derivative `dV/dx`.
    *   Result: `dV/dx = -r * I(x)` **(Equation 1)**

3.  **Analyze the current loss through the shunt conductance:**
    *   The conductance of the leakage path for the segment is `g * Δx`.
    *   The current flowing *through* this leakage path is driven by the voltage `V(x)` across it (relative to the reference potential, assumed 0V). (Again, for small `Δx`, we can approximate the voltage across the shunt conductance as `V(x)` or `V(x + Δx/2)`, leading to the same result in the limit).
    *   Leakage current `ΔI_leak = V(x) * (g * Δx)`.
    *   This leakage current represents a *loss* of current from the main path. By Kirchhoff's Current Law applied to the segment, the current entering `I(x)` must equal the current leaving `I(x + Δx)` plus the current leaked `ΔI_leak`.
    *   `I(x) = I(x + Δx) + ΔI_leak`
    *   Rearrange: `I(x + Δx) - I(x) = -ΔI_leak = -V(x) * (g * Δx)`.
    *   Divide by `Δx`: `[I(x + Δx) - I(x)] / Δx = -g * V(x)`.
    *   Take the limit as `Δx → 0`: The left side becomes the definition of the derivative `dI/dx`.
    *   Result: `dI/dx = -g * V(x)` **(Equation 2)**

4.  **Obtain the Second-Order Equations (Optional but helpful for the overall goal):**
    *   Differentiate Eq. 1 w.r.t. `x`: `d²V/dx² = -r * dI/dx`.
    *   Substitute Eq. 2 into this: `d²V/dx² = -r * (-g * V(x)) = (r * g) * V(x)`.
    *   Differentiate Eq. 2 w.r.t. `x`: `d²I/dx² = -g * dV/dx`.
    *   Substitute Eq. 1 into this: `d²I/dx² = -g * (-r * I(x)) = (r * g) * I(x)`.

5.  **Summary of results:** The derivation based on the small segment `Δx` yields the two coupled first-order differential equations:
    *   `dV/dx = -r * I(x)`
    *   `dI/dx = -g * V(x)`
    And consequently the second-order equations:
    *   `d²V/dx² = (r * g) * V(x)`
    *   `d²I/dx² = (r * g) * I(x)`
