The user wants me to explicitly state the mathematical origin of `cosh` and `sinh` in this context. This involves:
1.  Referencing the second-order differential equations derived previously.
2.  Introducing the parameter `α`.
3.  Declaring `cosh(αx)` and `sinh(αThex)` as the basis functions for the general solution.
