Thinking Process:

1.  **Goal:** The user wants a specific part of the derivation articulated clearly: how the voltage change (`ΔV`) across a small segment (`Δx`) relates to the current (`I(x)`) and the distributed resistance (`r`), leading to the first differential equation (`dV/dx = -rI`).

2.  **Identify Key Components:**
    *   Small segment of length `Δx`.
    *   Position `x`.
    *   Voltage at the start: `V(x)`.
    *   Voltage at the end: `V(x + Δx)`.
    *   Current flowing through the segment: Needs careful consideration. Is it `I(x)`, `I(x + Δx)`, or some average? For an infinitesimal segment, the current *entering* (`I(x)`) is the most direct cause of the voltage drop across the *first* part of the segment's resistance. As `Δx -> 0`, the distinction vanishes. Using `I(x)` is standard and correct in the limit.
    *   Resistance of the segment: `R_seg = r * Δx`.
    *   Fundamental Law: Ohm's Law (`V = IR` or `ΔV = I * R`).

3.  **Apply Ohm's Law:**
    *   The voltage *drop* across the resistance `R_seg` is `I * R_seg`.
    *   So, the *drop* is `I(x) * (r * Δx)`.
    *   The voltage *change* from the start (`V(x)`) to the end (`V(x + Δx)`) is the negative of the drop (since voltage decreases in the direction of current flow).
    *   Therefore, `ΔV = V(x + Δx) - V(x) = - (Voltage Drop) = -I(x) * (r * Δx)`.

4.  **Form the Difference Quotient:**
    *   To get towards the derivative, divide the voltage change (`ΔV`) by the length of the segment (`Δx`):
        `(V(x + Δx) - V(x)) / Δx = -I(x) * (r * Δx) / Δx`
    *   Simplify:
        `(V(x + Δx) - V(x)) / Δx = -r * I(x)`

5.  **Take the Limit:**
    *   Apply the definition of the derivative: `lim (Δx -> 0) [(V(x + Δx) - V(x)) / Δx] = dV/dx`.
    *   The right side, `-r * I(x)`, does not explicitly depend on `Δx` in this formulation.
    *   Taking the limit of both sides yields:
        `dV/dx = -r * I(x)`

6.  **Final Statement:** Articulate this result clearly, labeling it as Equation 1 as requested by the user's context. Emphasize that this equation links the *spatial rate of change of voltage* to the *local current* and the *distributed resistance*.
