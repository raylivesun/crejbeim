Okay, let's explicitly state the mathematical origin of `cosh` and `sinh` in this problem.

**The Governing Differential Equations:**

From the analysis of the small segment (`Δx`), we derived the coupled first-order differential equations:
1.  `dV/dx = -r * I`
2.  `dI/dx = -g * V`

To find equations solely for `V` or `I`, we differentiate one and substitute the other:

*   Differentiate (1) with respect to `x`: `d²V/dx² = -r * (dI/dx)`
*   Substitute (2) into this: `d²V/dx² = -r *
