Okay, let's walk through the process of **combining the two coupled first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs)** to obtain the uncoupled second-order ODEs for voltage (`V`) and current (`I`).

We start with the equations derived from analyzing the infinitesimal segment:
1.  `dV/dx = -r * I(x)`  --- (Equation 1: Relates voltage gradient to current)
2.  `dI/dx = -g * V(x)`  --- (Equation 2: Relates current gradient to voltage)

Our goal is to eliminate one variable (`I` or `V`) to get an equation involving only the other variable and its derivatives.

**Deriving the Second-Order ODE for Voltage (V):**

1.  **Differentiate Equation 1:** Take the derivative of both sides of Equation 1 with respect to `x`:
    `d/dx (dV/dx) = d/dx (-r * I(x))`
    Assuming `r` is constant along the path:
    `d²V/dx² = -r * (dI/dx)`

2.  **Substitute Equation 2:** Notice that the term `dI/dx` appears on the right side. We already have an expression for `dI/dx` from Equation 2: `dI/dx = -g * V(x)`. Substitute this into the equation from step 1:
    `d²V/dx² = -r * (-g * V(x))`

3.  **Simplify:** Multiply the terms on the right side:
    **`d²V/dx² = (r * g) * V(x)`**

**Deriving the Second-Order ODE for Current (I):**

1.  **Differentiate Equation 2:** Take the derivative of both sides of Equation 2 with respect to `x`:
    `d/dx (dI/dx) = d/dx (-g * V(x))`
    Assuming `g` is constant along the path:
    `d²I/dx² = -g * (dV/dx)`

2.  **Substitute Equation 1:** Notice that the term `dV/dx` appears on the right side. We have an expression for `dV/dx` from Equation 1: `dV/dx = -r * I(x)`. Substitute this into the equation from step 1:
    `d²I/dx² = -g * (-r * I(x))`

3.  **Simplify:** Multiply the terms on the right side:
    **`d²I/dx² = (r * g) * I(x)`**

**Result:**

By differentiating the coupled first-order equations and substituting one into the other, we have successfully decoupled the system and obtained two independent second-order linear homogeneous differential equations:

*   For Voltage: **`d²V/dx² = (r * g) * V`**
*   For Current: **`d²I/dx² = (r * g) * I`**

These equations show that both voltage and current distributions along the leaky, resistive path follow the same mathematical form, where the second derivative is proportional to the function itself, with the constant of proportionality being the product `r * g`. This specific form is what directly leads to solutions involving hyperbolic functions (`cosh` and `sinh`) or equivalently, exponentials (`e^(αx)` and `e^(-αx)` where `α² = rg`).
