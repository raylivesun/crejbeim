Okay, let's detail the step for deriving the **Voltage Change** equation.

1.  **Focus on the Segment:** We isolate a small segment of the conductive path, located at position `x` and having an infinitesimal length `Δx`.

2.  **Identify Segment Resistance:** The resistance of just this small segment is given by the resistance per unit length (`r`) multiplied by the segment's length (`Δx`). So, `R_segment = r * Δx`.

3.  **Consider Current Flow:** Current `I(x)` enters the segment at position `x`. This current flows through the segment's resistance `R_segment`.

4.  **Apply Ohm's Law:** Ohm's Law states that the voltage drop across a resistor is equal to the current flowing through it multiplied by its resistance (`Voltage Drop = I * R`). Applying this to our segment:
    `Voltage Drop across segment = I(x) * R_segment`
    `Voltage Drop across segment = I(x) * (r * Δx)`

5.  **Relate Drop to Voltage Change:** The voltage `V(x)` is the potential at the start of the segment, and `V(x + Δx)` is the potential at the end. The voltage *drop* means that the voltage at the end is lower than the voltage at the start (assuming positive current `I(x)` flows from `x` to `x+Δx`).
    Therefore, the *change* in voltage, `ΔV = V(x + Δx) - V(x)`, is the *negative* of the voltage drop:
    `ΔV = V(x + Δx) - V(x) = - (Voltage Drop across segment)`
    `V(x + Δx) - V(x) = - I(x) * (r * Δx)`

6.  **Form the Differential:** To find the rate of change of voltage with respect to position, we divide the voltage change `ΔV` by the segment length `Δx`:
    `(V(x + Δx) - V(x)) / Δx = - I(x) * (r * Δx) / Δx`
    `(V(x + Δx) - V(x)) / Δx = -r * I(x)`

7.  **Take the Limit:** Finally, we consider what happens as the segment length `Δx` shrinks to zero. The left side of the equation becomes the definition of the derivative of `V` with respect to `x`:
    `lim (Δx -> 0) [(V(x + Δx) - V(x)) / Δx] = dV/dx`
    The right side remains `-r * I(x)`.
    Thus, in the limit, we obtain the first differential equation:
    **`dV/dx = -r * I(x)`** (Equation 1)

This equation fundamentally states that the rate at which voltage decreases along the path (`-dV/dx`) is directly proportional to the current flowing at that point (`I(x)`) and the path's resistance per unit length (`r`).
