Okay, let's detail the derivation for the **Current Change** equation.

1.  **Focus on the Segment:** We are again considering the same small segment of the conductive path, length `Δx`, at position `x`.

2.  **Identify the Leakage Path:** Current `I(x)` enters the segment along the main path. However, because the insulation (passivation/dielectric) separating the path from the reference potential isn't perfect, some current can leak *out* of the path sideways through this insulation.

3.  **Quantify Segment Leakage Conductance:** The leakage path *for this specific segment* has a conductance given by the conductance per unit length (`g`) multiplied by the segment's length (`Δx`). So, `G_segment = g * Δx`.

4.  **Calculate Leakage Current (`ΔI_leak`):** The amount of current flowing through this leakage conductance `G_segment` is determined by the voltage across it. The voltage across the insulator is simply the voltage of the conductor `V(x)` relative to the reference potential (assumed to be 0V for simplicity, otherwise it's the voltage difference). Using Ohm's Law for conductance (`Current = Voltage * Conductance`):
    `ΔI_leak ≈ V(x) * G_segment`
    `ΔI_leak ≈ V(x) * (g * Δx)`
    *(Note: We use V(x) as the approximate voltage over the entire small segment. As Δx -> 0, this becomes exact).* This `ΔI_leak` represents the total current escaping the main path within this segment `Δx`.

5.  **Apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (Conservation of Charge):** The current entering the segment `I(x)` must equal the sum of the current leaving the segment along the path `I(x + Δx)` and the current leaving through the leakage path `ΔI_leak`.
    `I(x) = I(x + Δx) + ΔI_leak`

6.  **Find the Change in Path Current (`ΔI`):** We are interested in how the current *along the path* changes, which is `ΔI = I(x + Δx) - I(x)`. Rearranging the conservation equation:
    `I(x + Δx) - I(x) = -ΔI_leak`
    This shows that the change in current along the path is precisely the negative of the current that leaked out.
    Substitute the expression for `ΔI_leak`:
    `ΔI = I(x + Δx) - I(x) ≈ - V(x) * (g * Δx)`

7.  **Form the Differential:** Divide the change in path current `ΔI` by the segment length `Δx`:
    `(I(x + Δx) - I(x)) / Δx ≈ - V(x) * (g * Δx) / Δx`
    `(I(x + Δx) - I(x)) / Δx ≈ -g * V(x)`

8.  **Take the Limit:** As the segment length `Δx` approaches zero, the left side becomes the definition of the derivative of `I` with respect to `x`:
    `lim (Δx -> 0) [(I(x + Δx) - I(x)) / Δx] = dI/dx`
    The right side remains `-g * V(x)`.
    Thus, in the limit, we obtain the second differential equation:
    **`dI/dx = -g * V(x)`** (Equation 2)

This equation states that the rate of change of current along the path (`dI/dx`) is negative (current decreases) and proportional to the local voltage `V(x)` (which drives the leakage) and the leakage conductance per unit length `g`.
