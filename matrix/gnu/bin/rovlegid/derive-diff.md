Okay, let's derive the differential equations by considering a small segment of the path.

**Visualizing the Segment:**

Imagine we zoom in on a tiny piece of the conductor path at position `x`. This segment has a small length `Δx`.

*   **Resistance of the segment:** `r * Δx` (Ohms)
*   **Conductance of the leakage path for this segment:** `g * Δx` (Siemens)

Let's define the voltages and currents at the boundaries of this segment:

*   Voltage at the start (`x`): `V(x)`
*   Voltage at the end (`x + Δx`): `V(x + Δx)`
*   Current entering the segment (`x`): `I(x)`
*   Current leaving the segment (`x + Δx`): `I(x + Δx)`

**Applying Fundamental Laws:**

1.  **Voltage Change (Ohm's Law along the path):**
    *   The change in voltage `V(x + Δx) - V(x)` occurs because the current `I(x)` flows through the segment's resistance `r * Δx`.
    *   Using Ohm's Law (`ΔV = I * R`), and noting that voltage drops in the direction of current:
        `V(x + Δx) - V(x) ≈ -I(x) * (r * Δx)`
        *(We use `I(x)` as an approximation for the current throughout the small segment. A more rigorous approach uses `I` somewhere within the segment, but the result is the same as `Δx → 0`)*.
    *   Divide by `Δx`:
        `[V(x + Δx) - V(x)] / Δx ≈ -r * I(x)`
    *   Now, take the limit as `Δx` approaches zero. The left side becomes the definition of the derivative `dV/dx`:
        **`dV/dx = -r * I(x)`**  --- (Equation 1: Voltage change related to current)

2.  **Current Change (Kirchhoff's Current Law & Leakage):**
    *   The current changes from `I(x)` to `I(x + Δx)` because some current leaks out through the shunt conductance `g * Δx`.
    *   The amount of leakage current `ΔI_leak` is driven by the voltage `V(x)` across the conductance `g * Δx`.
    *   Using Ohm's Law for conductance (`I = V * G`):
        `ΔI_leak ≈ V(x) * (g * Δx)`
        *(Again, `V(x)` approximates the voltage across the shunt element for small `Δx`)*.
    *   Applying Kirchhoff's Current Law to the node within the segment: Current In = Current Out.
        `I(x) = I(x + Δx) + ΔI_leak`
    *   Rearranging to find the change in current along the path:
        `I(x + Δx) - I(x) = -ΔI_leak ≈ -V(x) * (g * Δx)`
    *   Divide by `Δx`:
        `[I(x + Δx) - I(x)] / Δx ≈ -g * V(x)`
    *   Take the limit as `Δx` approaches zero. The left side becomes the definition of the derivative `dI/dx`:
        **`dI/dx = -g * V(x)`**  --- (Equation 2: Current change related to voltage)

**Summary of Derived Equations:**

By analyzing an infinitesimal segment `Δx` of the conductor with distributed resistance `r` and distributed leakage conductance `g`, we have derived two coupled first-order linear differential equations:

1.  `dV/dx = -r * I`
2.  `dI/dx = -g * V`

These equations precisely describe how voltage and current change at any point `x` along the path due to the physical properties of the conductor and the surrounding leaky insulator (passivation/dielectric). From these, we can derive the second-order equations (`d²V/dx² = rgV` and `d²I/dx² = rgI`) which lead directly to the `cosh` and `sinh` solutions.
