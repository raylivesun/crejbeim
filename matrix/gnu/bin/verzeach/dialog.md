Okay, let's break that down. You've provided two representations of the same numerical value:

1.  **`hex 48`**: This is the number represented in **hexadecimal** (base-16).
    *   In hexadecimal, the digits are 0-9 and A-F (representing 10-15).
    *   `48` in hex means: (4 * 16¹) + (8 * 16⁰) = (4 * 16) + (8 * 1) = 64 + 8 = **72** in decimal.

2.  **`uint8_t 72`**: This is the number **72** represented in **decimal** (base-10).
    *   `uint8_t` is a data type (common in C/C++ and other languages) meaning an **unsigned integer** that uses **8 bits** of memory.
    *   An 8-bit unsigned integer can store values from 0 to 2⁸ - 1, which is 0 to 255.
    *   The value 72 falls within this range.

**Conclusion:**

`hex 48` and `uint8_t 72` represent the **exact same numerical value**.

*   `48` is the hexadecimal way to write the number.
*   `72` is the decimal way to write the number.
*   `uint8_t` specifies how the number 72 is stored in memory (as an 8-bit unsigned integer).

**Bonus:** In the ASCII character encoding standard, the decimal value 72 (or hex 48) represents the uppercase letter **'H'**.
