1.  **Identify the core components:** The user provided "48", "uint16_t", and "72".
2.  **Analyze `uint16_t`:**
    *   `u`: Stands for **unsigned**. This means the integer cannot be negative and uses all bits to represent the magnitude.
    *   `int`: Stands for **integer**.
    *   `16`: Specifies that it uses exactly **16 bits** of memory.
    *   `_t`: Standard suffix indicating a defined type (from `<stdint.h>` or `<cstdint>`).
3.  **Determine the range of `uint16_t`:**
    *   Being unsigned and 16 bits, it can represent values from 0 up to (2^16 - 1).
    *   Calculate 2^16: 2^10 = 1024, 2^6 = 64. So, 2^16 = 1024 * 64 = 65536.
    *   The range is therefore **0 to 65535**.
4.  **Analyze the numbers `48` and `72`:**
    *   These are positive decimal integers.
5.  **Compare the numbers to the range:**
    *   Is 48 within the range [0, 65535]? Yes.
    *   Is 72 within the range [0, 65535]? Yes.
6.  **Formulate the conclusion:** Both 48 and 72 are valid values that can be represented by the `uint16_t` data type because they fall within its defined range.
7.  **Add binary representation (optional but helpful):**
    *   `48` in 16-bit binary: `00000000 00110000`
    *   `72` in 16-bit binary: `00000000 01001000`
