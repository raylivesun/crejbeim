Okay, let's analyze this:

1.  **`uint16_t`**: This is another standard integer type from C/C++.
    *   `u`: Stands for **unsigned**. This means it can only represent non-negative values (zero and positive integers).
    *   `int`: Specifies an integer type.
    *   `16`: Specifies that it uses exactly **16 bits** of memory.
    *   `_t`: A standard suffix indicating it's a defined type.

2.  **Range of `uint16_t`**: An 16-bit *unsigned* integer uses all 16 bits for the magnitude.
    *   The minimum value is 0.
    *   The maximum value is 2<sup>16</sup> - 1 = 65536 - 1 = **65535**.
    *   So, the range is **0 to 65535**.

3.  **`48` and `72`**: These are positive decimal integer values.

**Conclusion:**

Both the numbers `48` and `72` **can be correctly represented** by the `uint16_t` data type because they fall well within its valid range of 0 to 65535.

In binary (as 16-bit unsigned):
*   `48` is `00000000 00110000`
*   `72` is `00000000 01001000`
