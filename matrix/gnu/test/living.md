Okay, let's test applying `cosh` and `sinh` to matrices. There are two main ways to interpret this:

1.  **Element-wise Application:** Apply the `cosh` or `sinh` function to each individual element of the matrix. This is the most common interpretation when using standard numerical libraries like NumPy or MATLAB.
2.  **Matrix Function (using Taylor Series):** Define the function for a square matrix `A` using its Taylor series expansion:
    *   `cosh(A) = I + A²/2! + A⁴/4! + A⁶/6! + ...`
    *   `sinh(A) = A + A³/3! + A⁵/5! + A⁷/7! + ...`
    (where `I` is the identity matrix and powers are matrix powers). This is a more advanced concept from linear algebra, usually requiring specialized functions (often found in libraries like SciPy's `linalg` module or MATLAB's `coshm`/`sinhm`).

Let's primarily focus on the **element-wise** approach, as it's the direct application of the library functions you asked about earlier. We'll use Python with NumPy, which is ideal for this. We'll also briefly show the matrix function approach using SciPy for comparison.

**Method 1: Element-wise Application (Most Common)**

This applies the standard `cosh` or `sinh` function independently to every number within the matrix.

**Using Python with NumPy:**

```python
import numpy as np
import math # For comparison if needed

# Create a sample matrix (NumPy array)
# Can be any shape
A = np.array([
    [0, 1, -1],
    [0.5, -0.5, 2.0]
])

print("Original Matrix A:\n", A)
print("-" * 20)

# --- Test cosh (element-wise) ---
cosh_A_elementwise = np.cosh(A)
print("Element-wise cosh(A):\n", cosh_A_elementwise)

# Verification (optional): calculate for one element
# print("Manual check for A[0,1]: math.cosh(1) =", math.cosh(1)) # Should match cosh_A_elementwise[0, 1]
# print("Manual check for A[1,2]: math.cosh(2) =", math.cosh(2)) # Should match cosh_A_elementwise[1, 2]
print("-" * 20)


# --- Test sinh (element-wise) ---
sinh_A_elementwise = np.sinh(A)
print("Element-wise sinh(A):\n", sinh_A_elementwise)

# Verification (optional): calculate for one element
# print("Manual check for A[0,1]: math.sinh(1) =", math.sinh(1)) # Should match sinh_A_elementwise[0, 1]
# print("Manual check for A[1,0]: math.sinh(0.5) =", math.sinh(0.5)) # Should match sinh_A_elementwise[1, 0]
print("-" * 20)

# --- Check the identity cosh^2(x) - sinh^2(x) = 1 element-wise ---
# Remember: Use element-wise power **, not matrix power @
identity_check = np.cosh(A)**2 - np.sinh(A)**2
print("Element-wise cosh(A)^2 - sinh(A)^2 (should be close to 1s):\n", identity_check)
# Use np.allclose for comparing floating-point arrays
print("Is identity close to 1? ", np.allclose(identity_check, np.ones_like(A)))
```

**Explanation:**

*   NumPy's `np.cosh()` and `np.sinh()` functions are "vectorized". When you pass a NumPy array (matrix) to them, they automatically apply the operation to each element.
*   The result is a matrix of the same shape as the input, where each element is the `cosh` or `sinh` of the corresponding element in the original matrix.
*   The identity `cosh²(x) - sinh²(x) = 1` holds true for each element individually.

**Method 2: Matrix Function (Taylor Series - Advanced)**

This requires a **square matrix** and specialized functions.

**Using Python with SciPy:**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import cosh as cosh_matrix # Rename to avoid conflict
from scipy.linalg import sinh as sinh_matrix # Rename to avoid conflict
from scipy.linalg import inv

# Create a sample SQUARE matrix
B = np.array([
    [1, 2],
    [0, 1]
])
# B = np.array([[0, math.pi/4],[-math.pi/4, 0]]) # Another example

print("\nOriginal Square Matrix B:\n", B)
print("-" * 30)

# --- Test Matrix cosh (Taylor Series) ---
try:
    cosh_B_matrix = cosh_matrix(B)
    print("Matrix cosh(B) (Taylor Series):\n", cosh_B_matrix)
except Exception as e:
    print("Could not compute matrix cosh:", e)
print("-" * 30)

# --- Test Matrix sinh (Taylor Series) ---
try:
    sinh_B_matrix = sinh_matrix(B)
    print("Matrix sinh(B) (Taylor Series):\n", sinh_B_matrix)
except Exception as e:
    print("Could not compute matrix sinh:", e)
print("-" * 30)

# --- Check the identity cosh^2(A) - sinh^2(A) = I (using matrix multiplication @) ---
# This identity holds for the matrix function definition
try:
    identity_matrix_check = (cosh_B_matrix @ cosh_B_matrix) - (sinh_B_matrix @ sinh_B_matrix)
    print("Matrix [cosh(B)]^2 - [sinh(B)]^2 (should be close to Identity Matrix):\n", identity_matrix_check)
    # Use np.allclose for comparing floating-point arrays
    identity_B = np.identity(B.shape[0])
    print("Is identity close to I? ", np.allclose(identity_matrix_check, identity_B))
except Exception as e:
     print("Could not compute matrix identity check:", e)

```

**Explanation:**

*   We import `cosh` and `sinh` from `scipy.linalg`. These functions compute the true matrix function based on the Taylor series or other advanced algorithms (like Padé approximants or eigenvalue decomposition).
*   The input matrix **must be square**.
*   The result is fundamentally different from the element-wise calculation. It involves matrix powers and sums.
*   The matrix identity `cosh²(A) - sinh²(A) = I` (where `I` is the identity matrix and the squares represent matrix multiplication) holds for this definition.

---

**Conclusion:**

*   If you simply want to apply `cosh` or `sinh` to every number *inside* a matrix, use the standard library functions (like `np.cosh`, `np.sinh` in NumPy, or `cosh`, `sinh` in MATLAB) which perform **element-wise** operations. This is the most common scenario.
*   If you need the mathematically defined **matrix function** (often used in solving systems of differential equations, control theory, etc.), you need specialized functions like those in `scipy.linalg` or MATLAB's `coshm`/`sinhm`, and your input must be a square matrix.
