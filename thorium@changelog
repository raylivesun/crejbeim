‚Å†‚î£Ôºûthorium Tool / Flags / In-App Settings & Extensions now available
The flags were taken from my list in ‚Å†‚î£Ôºûungoogled, as they're both chromium based

What does the tool contain?
Installer
Redirects you to Thorium-Win/releases, as it doesn't has a permanent download link
Debloat
Error reporting related files
Notification helper
Language files (only leaves en-US)
Installer leftovers, logs
Thorium Shell
More info here
Packaging tools
Thorium icons/images
May break some icons (not for me)
Chromedriver
"ChromeDriver is a separate executable that Selenium WebDriver uses to control Chrome" ~ info
Thor_ver
Removing thor_ver -> breaks winupdater? (*)
Winupdater is discontinued, so the file can be removed safely
Cleaner
Removes the following (yes, the same as in ‚Å†‚î£Ôºûungoogled):
Cached web assets
GPU and shader caches
Session storage
And more...
